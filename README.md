## Project Overview ðŸŽ‰


Thank you for visiting my repository! I'd like to introduce you to Fields of Fame, a turn-based strategy computer game project developed by a
group of students. This exciting game is designed for up to 4 players and can be played in hot-seat mode, allowing you to enjoy multiplayer
battles with your friends on a single computer.

During the development process, in addition to enhancing our programming skills, we had the opportunity to learn about teamwork and project 
management using the Agile system, which was supervised by one of the instructors at Opole University of Technology. The game was
written in the Python programming language using the Pygame library.

Fields of Fame is set in a medieval setting and includes various mechanics, such as random events, a resource system, combat, building, and much more!
